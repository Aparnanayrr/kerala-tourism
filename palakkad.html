                    <h3>MALAMPUZHA DAM</h3>

                    <p>Malampuzha Garden in Palakkad district is the only rock-cut garden in South India made by Nek Chand, the renowned artist and winner of the prestigious Padmashree Award. The entire garden is made from broken pieces of bangles, tiles, used plastic cans, tins and other waste materials. Also situated in the gardens is the massive Malampuzha Yakshi (female vampire) built in 1969 by Kanayi Kunhiraman, a greatly respected sculptor from the state. It is a spectacular relic of art that we are lucky to still have with us. The flowering beds, fountains and rose gardens along with an aerial ropeway make it a place that instantly soothes your soul.

                        In the lower hills of the Western Ghats lies the beautiful Malampuzha township whose lush greenery and plethora of picnic spots make it a must-visit spot in these areas. It has really good trekking trails that are available to all with a penchant for the same. Malampuzha Gardens and the Irrigation Dam tend to be the areas that attract the highest number of visitors. Apart from being perfect picnic spots, there is a host of interesting trivia surrounding the place that adds to its appeal.</p>

                    <h3>TIPU'S FORT</h3>

                    <p> Tipu's Fort, also known as Palakkad Fort, is a beautifully maintained edifice in Palakkad district and was an important military base in the past. Rebuilt by Hyder Ali in the 18th century, the fort was under the Mysore rulers until the British took control of the place. It was then used for providing government services during the British era. Named after Hyder's son Tipu Sultan, it is an important historical destination today.

                        It is among the best preserved forts in South India. The thick laterite walls impress all who view it. People frequent the spot for relaxing walks and jogs. A large ground that lies between the Fort and the Palakkad town hall is an important location for public meetings and important functions. Today it is a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India. It is a preferred picnic spot for everyone visiting Palakkad..</p>
