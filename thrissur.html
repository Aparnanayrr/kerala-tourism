                    <h3 >ATHIRAPPILLY WATERFALLS</h3>
                    
                    <p>As you walk down the stone slabs that lead to the base of the Athirappilly waterfalls, a mysterious serenity overcomes you. It is Kerala's most famous and largest waterfall at over 80 ft high. The sight of the water crashing onto the ground leaves you with a sense of wonder at the sheer power and magnificence of nature. Located around 63 km from Thrissur district, it is a perennial picnic spot for people in the area and  beyond. Its surrounding greenery is perfect for walks and picnics with loved ones. Lying at the entrance to the Sholayar forest ranges, it is a part of the Chalakudy River which calls the Western Ghats its home.

                        Barely 5 km away is another family favourite, Vazhachal Waterfalls. These waterfalls became famous for not just their view but the endemic species found in the surrounding dense forests. Researchers have found four endangered species of the Hornbill here, the only place they thrive in the entire Western Ghats. Ornithologists attach great significance to this location and bird watchers can come across many rare and vibrant species in these parts.</p>

                    <h3>SRI VADAKKUNNATHAN TEMPLE</h3>

                    <p>Vadakkumnathan Temple is an ancient Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva at city of Thrissur, of Kerala state in India. This temple is a classical example of the architectural style of Kerala and has one monumental tower on each of the four sides in addition to a kuttambalam. Mural paintings depicting various scenes from the Mahabharata can be seen inside the temple.[1][2][3] The shrines and the Kuttambalam display vignettes carved in wood. The temple, along with the mural paintings, has been declared as a National Monument by India under the AMASR Act.[4] According to popular local lore, this is the first temple built by Parasurama, the sixth avatara of Vishnu. Thekkinkadu Maidan, encircling the Vadakkunnathan Temple, is the main venue of the renowned Thrissur Pooram festival.[1][2]

                        In the year 2012 the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has recommended 14 sites, including Vadakkumnathan Temple and palaces, from Kerala to include in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[5] The temple is also the first one among the 108 Shiva Temples in ancient Kerala, established by Parasurama..</p>

                    <h3>PUNNATHUR KOTTA</h3>

                    <p> Punnathurkotta was once the palace of a local ruler, but the palace grounds are now used to house the elephants belonging to the Guruvayoor temple, and has been renamed Anakkotta (meaning "Elephant Fort"). There were 86 elephants housed there, but currently there are about 59 elephants. The elephants are ritual offerings made by the devotees of Lord Guruvayurappa.

                        Described as a 'Palace for Elephants,' [2] this facility is also used to train the elephants to serve Lord Krishna as well as to participate in many festivals that occur throughout the year. The oldest elephant is around 82 years of age and is called 'Ramachandran'. The rituals of Gajapooja (Worshipping Elephants) and Anayoottu (Feeding Elephants) are observed here, as an offering to Lord Ganesha. The legendary elephant "Guruvayur Keshavan" was housed here.
                        
                        The compound also has a naalu kettu, a traditional rectangular home with a central courtyard, which belonged to the Punnathur Raja. It presently houses a training school for Papans (Mahout).</p>
