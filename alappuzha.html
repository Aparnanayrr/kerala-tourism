                    <h3 >VEMBANAD LAKE</h3>
                    
                    <p>Vembanad, also known as Punnamada is the longest lake in India,[1] as well as the largest lake in the state of Kerala. With an area of 2033 square kilometers and a maximum length of 96.5 km, it is the second largest Ramsar site in India only after the Sunderbans in West Bengal. Spanning several districts in the state of Kerala, it is known as Vembanadu Lake in Kottayam, Vaikom, Changanassery, Punnamada Lake in Alappuzha, Punnappra, Kuttanadu and Kochi Lake in Kochi. Several groups of small islands including Vypin, Mulavukad, Maradu, Udayamperoor, Vallarpadam, Willingdon Island are located in the Kochi Lake portion. Kochi Port is built around the Willingdon Island and the Vallarpadam island.

                        Kuttanad, also known as The Rice Bowl of Kerala, has the lowest altitude in India, and is also one of the few places in world where cultivation takes place below sea level.[2][3] Kuttanad lies on the southern portion of Vembanad.
                        
                        The Nehru Trophy Boat Race is conducted in a portion of the lake. High levels of pollution have been noticed at certain hotspots of the Vembanad backwaters. The Government of India has identified the Vembanad wetland under the National Wetlands Conservation Programme.</p>

                    <h3>PATHIRAMANAL ISLAND</h3>

                    <p>Pathiramanal is a bird watcherâ€™s paradise. It is about 1.5 km from Muhamma Boat Jetty and about 13 km from Alappuzha. This small island on the backwaters is a safe haven for hundreds of rare migrating birds. A 1.5 hour motor boat ride or a 30 minute speedboat trip from Alappuzha gets you here. Surrounded by the Vembanad Lake, stretching from Alappuzha to Kochi and the Kayamkulam Lake, Pathiramanal is accessible only by boat. It is an ideal pit stop in the middle of a houseboat ride.

                        The name 'Pathiramanal' means 'Sands of Night'. Estimates say that the area has 91 local species of birds and 50 migratory birds. One can see Pintail Ducks, Common Teal, Night Heron, Cormorant, Darter, Indian Shag, Purple Heron, Cattle Egret, Indian Pond Heron, Little Egret, Bronze-winged Jacanas, Stork-billed Kingfisher, Whistling Duck, Cotton Pygmy-Goose, Little Cormorant and Whiskered Tern. Avid bird watchers will indeed find few other places that rival Pathiramanal.</p>

                    <p> The sea-side village experience set on 30 acres with coconut groves, lily ponds, fruit trees and a large organic farm.

                        The seaside resort, Marari beach in Mararikulam, is a tribute to the fisherfolk of this region who populate its spirit in obvious and subtle ways. The guest cottages echo their dwellings in style and character while our cuisine reflects the culinary subtleties of these people whose sensibilities and culture have been influenced by the charms and challenges of the oceans.</p>
